    <h1>JOSH ALLEN</h1>
    <p>Josh Allen is an elite American football quarterback for the NFL's Buffalo Bills, renowned for his exceptional arm strength and dual-threat ability as both a passer and a runner. Born in Firebaugh, California, Allen was an unheralded high school prospect who received no Division I college scholarship offers, eventually beginning his collegiate career at a junior college before transferring to the University of Wyoming. Drafted by the Bills as the seventh overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, he has developed into one of the league's top players, leading Buffalo to multiple playoff appearances and several division titles. In recognition of his outstanding performance, Allen was named the NFL's Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the 2024 season, though his ultimate career goal remains winning a Super Bowl.</p>
