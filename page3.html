    <h1>TOM BRADY</h1>
    <p>Tom Brady is a legendary former professional American football quarterback, widely considered the greatest of all time (GOAT). Drafted 199th overall in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft from the University of Michigan, he spent his first 20 seasons with the New England Patriots, transforming the franchise into a dynasty and winning an unprecedented six Super Bowl titles. In 2020, at age 42, he joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and led them to a Super Bowl LV victory, securing his record seventh championship. Known for his exceptional leadership, mental toughness, and competitive drive rather than raw athleticism, Brady holds numerous NFL records, including most career passing yards, completions, and touchdown passes. He retired "for good" in February 2023 and has since transitioned to a career in broadcasting with Fox Sports, while also becoming a partial owner of the Las Vegas Raiders.</p>
